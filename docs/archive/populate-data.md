the data is in @spider/output/species/

let's write a script to populate data to the db, we can initially populate one species at a time, test if it works and then scale it up to adding multiple at a time

Data Structure Analysis:

- Each JSON file contains an array with a single species object
- Species have: basic_info, images, nomenclature, description sections (stem_bark, seed, fruit, flower, leaf, habit), ecology, human_uses, conservation
- Description sections contain text, text_html, and images arrays
- We need to map this nested structure to our relational schema

Implementation Plan:

1. Create a population script (scripts/populate-db.ts)


    - Read JSON files from spider/output/species/
    - Transform data to match our schema
    - Insert into D1 database

2. Data Mapping Strategy:


    - species table: basic_info â†’ scientific_name, family, category (hardcode as 'plants')
    - languages table: Pre-populate common Indian languages from the data
    - names table: Extract from nomenclature.english_names, indian_names
    - sections table: Map each description section (stem_bark, seed, fruit, etc.) as separate sections
    - section_images table: Map images from each description section
    - attributes table: Could extract from habit text (deciduous, evergreen, etc.) - but skip for now

3. Start with one species (species-1.json - Tamarindus indica)


    - Test the complete flow
    - Verify data integrity
    - Then scale to all species

4. Script features:


    - Read single file or directory
    - Transaction support for data consistency
    - Error handling and logging
    - Skip duplicates (check scientific_name)
